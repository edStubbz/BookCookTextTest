# Testing Plan

## Harness functionality 
The harness provided by group one is used to create a textbox on a stage using all parameters available to the library's user. This allows for the user to determine the functionality of each of the text box's parameters. 

As the harness is created so that the library is imported in the same way that a user of the code would import it, we can simply conduct testing using the harness to ensure that the code runs as expected.

## The testing process
The process for this testing was to ensure that the parameters, when adjusted operate as intended. Furthermore tests were done using erroneous values for textbox parameters to determine how the code would behave.

## Conclusion
